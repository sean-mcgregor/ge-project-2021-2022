# What I am most proud of in the assignment
I entered this assignment panicked and uncomfortable. I had no experience ever with Unity or with C# in general. I really did not enjoy the initial days of development and I was very worried that I was incapable of developing a project which I would be proud to demo. However, with some perseverance, I found myself becoming more fond of Unity and of game development in general. As I became more familiar with Unity's user interface as well as the style of programming and Object relationships, my project developed from something incredibly basic to something which I was very proud to put my name to. I am most proud of the development of my Unity and C# skills development over time, as I saw myself transition from watching tutorials on the most basic of concepts, to developing my own code and scripts without any assistance. I am specifically proud of the transition between player characters, which I implemented myself and had the idea of without any tutorials or aid.

# Proposal submitted earlier can go here:
This project will feature a beautiful procedurally generated world which the user can wander and explore. It will look like an immersive, natural, landscape, but feature a simple art style. There will be some animals to see around the landscape, too.

This is code:

```Java
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```

So is this without specifying the language:

```
public void render()
{
	ui.noFill();
	ui.stroke(255);
	ui.rect(x, y, width, height);
	ui.textAlign(PApplet.CENTER, PApplet.CENTER);
	ui.text(text, x + width * 0.5f, y + height * 0.5f);
}
```
